# 👋 Hi, I'm Camille Robichon

🎓 PhD in Food Science (lipid oxidation & antioxidant kinetics)  
🧪 Researcher working on **oxidative stability in emulsions**, **antioxidant interactions**, and **kinetic modelling**.  
💻 I build **MATLAB tools** to analyse complex degradation curves and compare kinetic models in a transparent, reproducible way.

## 🔬 Research interests

- Lipid oxidation in oil-in-water emulsions  
- Antioxidant efficiency (tocopherols, phenolics, curcumin…)  
- Synergistic / additive / antagonistic interactions  
- Kinetic modelling and statistical model selection  
- Food formulation and shelf-life prediction  

---

## 🧮 Modelling & code

I like turning experimental curves into interpretable parameters.

**Main repositories:**

- 🧾 **Weibull Modelling for Antioxidant Interaction Efficiency**  
  `Weibull-Modelling-for-Antioxidant-Interaction-Efficiency`  
  > MATLAB workflow for Weibull-based kinetic fitting, PDF/dPDF computation, Monte Carlo uncertainty and Excel export.  
  > Used to analyse antioxidant interactions in O/W emulsions.  

- 📊 **Antioxidant Kinetic Model Comparison**  
  `Antioxidant-Kinetics-Model-Comparison`  
  > Comparative fitting of **Weibull, Gompertz, Logistic and Exponential** models.  
  > Includes AIC/BIC, Akaike weights and Vuong tests to identify the statistically best model per condition.
